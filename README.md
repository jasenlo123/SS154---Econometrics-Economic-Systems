# SS154---Econometrics-Economic-Systems
Learn how to use core econometric and statistical methods to construct and validate economic and social models. Students will learn methods to conduct and critique empirical studies in economics and related fields. We apply these techniques to answer questions such as: What are the effects of class size on test scores in California schools? Do cigarette taxes reduce smoking? Do drunk driving laws actually reduce traffic deaths? Do mosquito nets reduce the incidence of malaria? Quantitative approaches used to answer such questions include multiple regression, nonlinear regression and instrumental variables regression.
